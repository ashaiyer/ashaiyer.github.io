Lab 4: Your Portfolio 

# Description 
This is the README file for Lab 4. This lab involved creating a portfolio website with three main pages: index, bio, and resume. 
The index contains links to the resume and bio, both which work, as well as a photograph of a dog (instead of myself). The bio page is a brief summary of myself and my interests, and that page is the most colorful as I used the CSS commands to adjust the background and text colors. The resume covers my academics and professional experiences. All the requirements have been implemented. 

# Collaboration 
I have not collaborated with anyone or discussed with anyone on this lab. 

# Time Spent 
I spent approximately 2.5 hours on this lab.
